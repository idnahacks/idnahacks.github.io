# WELCOME

Infernal hails and welcome to the new blog!  

The plan is to use this as a place for me to post information about tools I've written or contributed to, CTF write-ups and walkthroughs and other ramblings around topics I feel like I want to ramble about in the Cyber security world.

## Coming soon
The initial plan is to write a piece on Active Directory session enumeration, and how my tool [NetCease++](https://github.com/idnahacks/NetCeasePlusPlus) can help network defenders to apply hardened settings, but still allow a least privilege model for enumerating their own domain.  

The natural follow on from that will be a run through of another tool [GoodHound](https://github.com/idnahacks/GoodHound), which can help offensive and defensive teams produce actionable attack paths from Bloodhound.

See you soon!
